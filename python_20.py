'''Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Python dictionary in the following fashion {"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":"gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"책r"} and use it to translate your Christmas cards from English into Swedish. That is, write a function translate() that takes a list of English words and returns a list of Swedish words.'''
